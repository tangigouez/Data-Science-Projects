# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

The goal of this project is to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

My purpose with this project was to create my first Machine Learning Data pipeline, understand the methodology leading to a prediction and execute some models I have learnt on a dataset.

You can download the data from this repo or directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

If you find any bugs, or make any improvements on the results in the notebook, I'd be glad to get some feedbacks.
